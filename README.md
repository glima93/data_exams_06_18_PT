# data_exams_06_18_PT
 Individual student data on national exams in Portugal.  Stata code included to merge all datasets and make them consistent through time.

To work with the data:
1. Unzip the data folder. 
2. Data folder contains files (in Portuguese) with micro-data on every student that sat basic education (eneb) and upper secondary (enes) national exams in Portugal, between 2006-2018. As soon as additional information is made available I will update the files here. Files are structured and stored in .mdb.
3. The stata do-file reads each of the files and builds a structured database with microdata for every student. Change working directories accordingly.
